A SIMD-accelerated library to compute random minimizers.

It can compute all the minimizers of a human genome in 4 seconds using a single thread.
It also provides a *canonical* version that ensures that a sequence and its reverse-complement always select the same positions, which takes 6 seconds on a human genome.

This crate builds on [`packed_seq`](https://github.com/rust-seq/packed-seq) and
[`seq-hash`](https://github.com/rust-seq/seq-hash).
 
The underlying algorithm is described in the following

## Requirements

This library supports AVX2 and NEON instruction sets.
Make sure to set `RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native"` when compiling to use the instruction sets available on your architecture.

``` sh
RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native" cargo run --release
```

## Usage example

Full documentation can be found on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/simd-minimizers).

```rust
use packed_seq::{PackedSeqVec, SeqVec};

let seq = b"ACGTGCTCAGAGACTCAGAGGA";
let packed_seq = PackedSeqVec::from_ascii(seq);

let k = 5;
let w = 7;
let hasher = <seq_hash::NtHasher>::new(k);

// Simple usage with default hasher, returning only positions.
let minimizer_positions = canonical_minimizer_positions(packed_seq.as_slice(), k, w);
assert_eq!(minimizer_positions, vec![0, 7, 9, 15]);

// Advanced usage with custom hasher, super-kmer positions, and minimizer values as well.
let mut minimizer_positions = Vec::new();
let mut super_kmers = Vec::new();
let minimizer_values: Vec<_> = canonical_minimizers(k, w)
    .hasher(&hasher)
    .super_kmers(&mut super_kmers)
    .run(packed_seq.as_slice(), &mut minimizer_positions)
    .values_u64()
    .collect();
```

## Benchmarks

Benchmarks can be found in the `bench` directory in the GitHub repository.

`bench/benches/bench.rs` contains benchmarks used in [this blogpost](https://curiouscoding.nl/posts/fast-minimizers/).

`bench/src/bin/paper.rs` contains benchmarks used in the paper.

Note that the benchmarks require some nightly features, you can install the latest nightly version with

```sh
rustup install nightly
```

To replicate results from the paper, go into `bench` and run
```sh
RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native" cargo +nightly run --release
python eval.py
```

The human genome we use is from the T2T consortium, and available by following
